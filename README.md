# deeplearningCS282A
Public repo for the 2019 Spring CS282A Deep Learning in UC Berkeley

The class contains 4 HW assignments and 1 project.
HW1 and 2 are completed and uploaded
HW3 and 4 are not completed due to my limited interest to NLP and RL. 
The rest of the semester, I put more time was on the SLM and heat transfer project.


### HW-1
  1. Fully connected neural networks
  2. Batch normalization
  3. Dropout
  4. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)
